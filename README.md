computer learns how to play pong

To be honest, it doesn't work great. It definitelylearns how to play and does become better, but I don't think the neural net is strong enough yet to effectively play. Sometimes it has really good games, and sometimes its just no where close. Still a work in progress.

Limitations: Requires a lot of training (I used my schools server to train it for a whole day). I think it needs additional layers but the neural net I wrote for it only works with 1 hidden layer. I'm trying to add additional layers, but so far it hasn't worked. Also, I don't really know how reinforcement learning works so I kind of cheated my way around it and used supervised learning instead, which isn't really the right way to learn to play a game.

Good Parts: It works. Sometimes it will play really well.

You can see a full description of the neural net and in my NeuralNet project.
