# PongAI
Description: Computer learns how to play pong.

To be honest, it doesn't work great. It definitely learns how to play and does become better, but I don't think the neural net is strong enough, yet, to effectively play. I think the neural net needs some additional functionality (multiple hidden layers, different activation functions) in order to perform well with this type of use. Sometimes it has really good games, and sometimes it's just no where close. Its still a work in progress.

Limitations: Requires a lot of training (I used my schools server to train it for a whole day). I think it needs additional layers but the neural net I wrote for it only works with 1 hidden layer. I'm trying to add additional layers, but so far it hasn't worked. Also, I don't really know how to implement a reinforcement learning model in order to train my neural net, so I kind of cheated my way around it and used supervised learning instead, which isn't really the right way to learn to play a game.

Good Parts: It works. Sometimes it will play really well. The GUI looks great and performs perfectly.

You can see a full description of the neural net and in my NeuralNet project.
